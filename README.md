# Reference-Centric Models for Grounded Collaborative Dialogue

Daniel Fried, Justin Chiu, and Dan Klein

EMNLP 2021

[Paper](http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/pubs/Fried-Chiu-Klein_2021_GroundedDialogue_paper.pdf)

Documentation coming (hopefully) soon! If you'd like to run the code or get our models in the meantime, please contact [Daniel Fried](https://dpfried.github.io/).

Our code draws heavily on the original code from Takuma Udagawa et al., which you can find at https://github.com/Alab-NII/onecommon, and which was used for the following papers:

(1) A Natural Language Corpus of Common Grounding under Continuous and Partially-Observable Context (Udagawa and Aizawa, AAAI 2019)

(2) An Annotated Corpus of Reference Resolution for Interpreting Common Grounding (Udagawa and Aizawa, AAAI 2020)

(3) A Linguistic Analysis of Visually Grounded Dialogues based on Spatial Expressions (Udagawa et al., Findings of EMNLP 2020)
